CCOM v5.0+ creates several configuration files:

```
.claude/
├── memory.json              # Project memory and features
├── agents/                  # Agent behavior specifications
├── validation_history.json  # Validation session history
├── pattern_learning.json    # Pattern learning data
└── context_intelligence.json # Context intelligence

.ccom/
├── config.json             # CCOM configuration
└── tools_state.json        # Tools management state
```

### **Memory Intelligence Configuration**

Advanced memory configuration in `.claude/memory-lifecycle.yml`:

```yaml
memory_management:
  smart_scoring:
    usage_frequency: 0.4     # How often feature is referenced
    file_dependencies: 0.3   # Number of files that depend on this
    user_interactions: 0.2   # User edits, deployments, mentions
    recent_modifications: 0.1 # Recently updated features stay active

  preservation_policies:
    preservation_score: 7.0  # Never archive above this score
    dependency_multiplier: 1.5 # High-dependency features stay longer
    respect_user_pins: true  # User-pinned immune from archiving
```

### **Validation Scoring Weights**

Customize principle weights in validation configuration:

```yaml
principles_validation:
  weights:
    kiss: 0.30  # Keep It Simple (30%)
    dry: 0.30   # Don't Repeat Yourself (30%)
    yagni: 0.20 # You Aren't Gonna Need It (20%)
