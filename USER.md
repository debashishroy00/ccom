## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **General Questions**

#### **Q: What is CCOM exactly?**
**A:** CCOM is a development automation tool that gives you enterprise-grade quality gates, security scanning, and deployment workflows through simple natural language commands. It's like having a senior developer looking over your shoulder, catching issues before they become problems.

#### **Q: Do I need to be an expert to use CCOM?**
**A:** No! CCOM is designed for "vibe coders" - developers who prefer natural language over complex tooling. Instead of memorizing 20 different CLI commands, just say `ccom "workflow quality"` and let it handle the details.

#### **Q: How is CCOM different from other tools?**
**A:** Most tools require you to configure and manage multiple separate tools (ESLint, Prettier, npm audit, etc.). CCOM integrates everything into simple workflows and speaks natural language. It's automation for developers who want to focus on building, not configuring.

### **Installation & Setup**

#### **Q: What are the requirements?**
**A:**
- Python 3.8+ (for CCOM)
- Node.js 16+ (for quality tools and file monitoring)
- Git (for memory persistence and GitHub integration)

#### **Q: Can I use CCOM in existing projects?**
**A:** Yes! Just run `ccom --init` in any project directory. CCOM will set up around your existing code without disrupting anything.

#### **Q: Will CCOM modify my code automatically?**
**A:** CCOM only reads and analyzes your code. It never automatically modifies your files. You stay in complete control of what gets changed and when.

#### **Q: How do I uninstall CCOM?**
**A:**
```bash
# Remove CCOM package
pip uninstall ccom

# Remove project files (optional)
rm -rf .ccom/
rm -rf .claude/
rm .github/workflows/ccom-quality.yml  # if you don't want GitHub Actions
```

### **Workflow Questions**

#### **Q: What happens if quality checks fail?**
**A:** CCOM shows you exactly what's wrong and suggests fixes. Quality failures don't break anything - they just give you information to improve your code. You can fix issues and re-run the check.

#### **Q: How do I fix formatting issues?**
**A:** Run `npm run format` or `npx prettier --write .` to auto-fix formatting issues, then re-run `ccom "workflow quality"`.

#### **Q: What if I don't have a build script?**
**A:** CCOM is smart about project types. If you don't have a build script, it skips the build step. If you're working on a static site, it validates the structure instead.

#### **Q: Can I customize what CCOM checks?**
**A:** Yes! CCOM respects your existing configuration:
- **ESLint**: Uses your `.eslintrc` if it exists
- **Prettier**: Uses your `.prettierrc` if it exists
- **TypeScript**: Uses your `tsconfig.json` if it exists
- **Tests**: Runs your `npm test` script if it exists

### **File Monitoring Questions**

#### **Q: Why isn't file monitoring triggering?**
**A:** Common causes:
- **OneDrive/Dropbox**: Cloud sync can interfere with file events
- **Solution**: Test in a non-synced directory like `C:\temp`
- **File type**: Make sure you're editing files that match the watch patterns (*.js, *.ts, etc.)

#### **Q: Can I change what files are monitored?**
**A:** Yes! Edit `.ccom/file-monitor.json` to customize watch patterns and ignore patterns.

#### **Q: How do I stop file monitoring?**
**A:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where monitoring is running, or close the terminal.

#### **Q: Does file monitoring work with all editors?**
**A:** Yes, but some editors work better than others:
- ✅ **VS Code, Sublime, Atom**: Work perfectly
- ✅ **Command line edits**: Work but may have delays
- ⚠️ **Some cloud editors**: May not trigger file system events

### **Security Questions**

#### **Q: What security issues does CCOM find?**
**A:** CCOM checks for:
- **Vulnerable dependencies**: Using npm audit
- **Hardcoded secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- **Dangerous code patterns**: eval(), innerHTML, document.write
- **Common security anti-patterns**: Based on OWASP guidelines

#### **Q: How do I fix security vulnerabilities?**
**A:**
- **Dependencies**: Run `npm audit fix` for automatic fixes
- **Secrets**: Move them to environment variables
- **Code patterns**: Replace with safer alternatives
- **Need help?**: CCOM provides specific guidance for each issue type

#### **Q: Is my code safe with CCOM?**
**A:** Yes! CCOM only runs locally on your machine. It never sends your code to external services. All analysis happens on your computer.

### **GitHub Actions Questions**

#### **Q: Do I need to configure GitHub Actions manually?**
**A:** No! Run `ccom "workflow setup"` and it creates a complete GitHub Actions workflow file. Just commit and push - it works immediately.
