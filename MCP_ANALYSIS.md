# MCP Memory Keeper Analysis for CCOM Integration

## Executive Summary

MCP Memory Keeper is a mature, production-ready MCP server that provides sophisticated context management for Claude. After thorough analysis, it appears to be an excellent fit for enhancing CCOM's memory capabilities.

## Core Findings

### 1. Memory Management Capabilities ✅

**Strengths:**
- **SQLite-based storage** with WAL mode for reliability and performance
- **Intelligent retention policies** to prevent memory bloat:
  - Age-based retention (e.g., "30d", "1y", "6m")
  - Size-based limits (max items/bytes)
  - Category-specific preservation rules
  - Priority-based retention (preserves critical/high priority)
- **Smart compaction** without information loss
- **Token limits management** with configurable safety buffers (25K default, up to 100K)
- **Automatic archiving** of old context

**Memory Lifecycle:**
- Items saved with categories (task, decision, progress, note, warning, error)
- Priorities (critical, high, normal, low)
- Private vs public context (session-specific vs shared)
- Channels for topic organization (auto-derived from git branches)

### 2. Context Organization ✅

**Channel System:**
- Persistent topic-based organization
- Automatic derivation from git branches
- Cross-session accessibility
- Channel statistics and insights

**Session Management:**
- Branching sessions (continue from previous)
- Session metadata and relationships
- Item counts and activity tracking

**Categorization:**
- Structured categories for different context types
- Priority levels for importance ranking
- Metadata support for additional context

### 3. Search and Retrieval ✅

**Semantic Search:**
- Vector store with embeddings (simple-git integration)
- Full-text search across all context
- Pattern matching with regex support
- Time-based filtering (createdAfter, createdBefore)

**Query Capabilities:**
- Pagination with limits and offsets
- Multiple sort orders (created, updated, priority)
- Filter by category, priority, channel
- Batch retrieval for efficiency

**Performance:**
- Fast SQLite queries with proper indexing
- Configurable result limits to prevent overload
- Token-aware response sizing

### 4. Integration Requirements ✅

**Installation:**
- Simple NPX installation: `npx mcp-memory-keeper`
- No complex dependencies beyond SQLite
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**MCP Protocol:**
- Standard MCP tools exposed through Claude
- Clean API with TypeScript definitions
- Well-documented tool parameters and returns

**Performance:**
- Minimal overhead (SQLite is fast)
- Configurable token limits
- Smart pagination to handle large contexts

## Integration Architecture Proposal

### Phase 1: Lightweight Bridge (Week 1)

```python
# ccom/mcp_bridge.py

class MCPMemoryBridge:
    """Bridge between CCOM and MCP Memory Keeper"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.channel_prefix = "ccom"
        self.session_name = None

    def save_context(self, feature: str, context_type: str, content: str, priority: str = "normal"):
        """Save context through MCP Memory Keeper"""
        # Use subprocess to call MCP tools or direct API if available
        channel = f"{self.channel_prefix}-{feature}"
        # Implementation to save via MCP

    def get_context(self, feature: str, context_type: str = None):
        """Retrieve relevant context for a feature"""
        channel = f"{self.channel_prefix}-{feature}"
        # Implementation to retrieve via MCP

    def create_checkpoint(self, name: str):
        """Create a checkpoint for current state"""
        # Implementation for checkpoint creation

    def restore_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id: str):
        """Restore from a checkpoint"""
        # Implementation for checkpoint restoration
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced CCOM Commands

```python
# Enhanced CLI commands in ccom/cli.py

@cli.command()
@click.argument('feature')
@click.argument('note')
def note(feature, note):
    """Save a note about a feature to memory"""
    bridge = MCPMemoryBridge()
    bridge.save_context(feature, "note", note)

@cli.command()
@click.argument('feature')
def resume(feature):
    """Resume work on a feature with full context"""
    bridge = MCPMemoryBridge()
    context = bridge.get_context(feature)
    # Display relevant context for resuming work

@cli.command()
def checkpoint():
    """Create a checkpoint of current context"""
    bridge = MCPMemoryBridge()
    checkpoint_id = bridge.create_checkpoint(f"ccom-{datetime.now()}")
    click.echo(f"Checkpoint created: {checkpoint_id}")
```

### Phase 3: Auto-Capture Integration

```python
# Auto-capture in ccom/orchestrator.py

class CCOMOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_bridge = MCPMemoryBridge()

    def run_quality_check(self, project_path):
        """Run quality check with auto-capture"""
        results = self._execute_quality_checks(project_path)

        # Auto-save results to memory
        self.memory_bridge.save_context(
            feature="quality",
            context_type="progress",
            content=json.dumps(results),
            priority="normal" if results['passed'] else "high"
        )

        return results
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Start with Read Operations
- Begin by integrating context retrieval
- Test with `ccom resume` command
- Validate search and filtering capabilities

### 2. Add Write Operations Gradually
- Implement `ccom note` for manual saves
- Add auto-capture for validation results
- Create checkpoint workflow

### 3. Migration Strategy
- Keep existing JSON memory as fallback
- Gradually migrate features to MCP
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 4. Testing Approach
```bash
# Test installation
npx mcp-memory-keeper

# Test basic operations
ccom note auth "Using JWT with refresh tokens"
ccom resume auth  # Should retrieve the note

# Test checkpoints
ccom checkpoint
ccom restore <checkpoint-id>
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risks ✅
- **Maturity**: Well-maintained, active development
- **Performance**: SQLite is battle-tested
- **Compatibility**: Standard MCP protocol

### Medium Risks ⚠️
- **Learning Curve**: New MCP concepts for team
- **Integration Complexity**: Bridge layer needs careful design

### Mitigations
- Start with simple integration
- Maintain existing memory as fallback
- Extensive testing before full rollout

## Success Metrics

1. **Context Retrieval Speed**: <100ms for relevant context
2. **Memory Efficiency**: No bloat after 3+ months of use
3. **User Experience**: Seamless context preservation
4. **Integration Simplicity**: <500 lines of bridge code

## Conclusion

MCP Memory Keeper is an excellent fit for CCOM's needs. It provides:
- ✅ Granular context tracking
- ✅ Intelligent memory management
- ✅ Fast semantic search
- ✅ Production-ready reliability

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 implementation immediately.

## Next Steps

1. Install MCP Memory Keeper locally for testing
2. Create minimal bridge implementation
3. Test with real CCOM workflows
4. Iterate based on user feedback
5. Full integration within 2-3 weeks
