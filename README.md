# CCOM v0.3 - Claude Code Orchestrator and Memory

🚀 **Enterprise-grade development automation with natural language interface**

CCOM transforms Claude Code into a powerful enterprise development platform with prefix-based activation, visual engagement indicators, and systematic workflow orchestration.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Prefix-Based Activation**
- Only commands starting with `"ccom"` activate enterprise automation
- Regular Claude Code behavior for all other interactions
- Clear visual distinction between CCOM and standard responses

### 🤖 **Visual Engagement Indicators**
```
🤖 **CCOM ENGAGED** - Enterprise automation activated
🚀 **CCOM ACTIVE** - Running enterprise-grade quality audit...
🔧 **CCOM ORCHESTRATING** - Quality gates and workflows activated
```

### 🛠️ **Enterprise Automation**
- **Quality Gates**: ESLint, Prettier, automated code fixes
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection and hardening
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Zero-downtime production deployments
- **Memory System**: Cross-session feature tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/debashishroy00/ccom.git
cd ccom

# Initialize in any project
python ccom/cli.py --init
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Natural language commands (recommended)
ccom "deploy my app"
ccom "check security vulnerabilities"
ccom "quality audit"
ccom "make it production ready"

# Traditional commands
ccom --status
ccom --memory
ccom --init
```

## 📋 Command Examples

### 🔧 **Quality & Testing**
```bash
ccom "test this app for code quality"
ccom "fix all linting issues"
ccom "make the code enterprise grade"
```

### 🔒 **Security**
```bash
ccom "scan for security vulnerabilities"
ccom "make this app bank-level secure"
ccom "check for hardcoded secrets"
```

### 🚀 **Deployment**
```bash
ccom "deploy to production"
ccom "ship it with all quality gates"
ccom "go live with enterprise standards"
```

### 🧠 **Memory Management**
```bash
ccom "remember this auth system"
ccom "what have we built so far?"
ccom "show project status"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Multi-Agent System**
- **Quality Enforcer**: Code standards and automated fixes
- **Security Guardian**: Vulnerability scanning and hardening
- **Deployment Specialist**: Production deployment coordination

### **Claude Code Integration**
- Native integration via `CLAUDE.md` configuration
- TodoWrite tool for systematic workflow tracking
- Automatic engagement detection and visual feedback

### **Cross-Project Support**
- Works in any project directory
- Consistent configuration across environments
- Portable agent system

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Project Initialization**
```bash
# Initialize CCOM in current project
python path/to/ccom/cli.py --init

# Force refresh existing configuration
python path/to/ccom/cli.py --init --force
```

### **Claude Code Integration**
CCOM automatically creates a `CLAUDE.md` file with:
- Prefix-based activation rules
- Enterprise workflow definitions
- Visual engagement protocols
- Quality and security standards

## 📊 Enterprise Features

### **Quality Gates**
- ✅ ESLint integration with auto-fix
- ✅ Prettier code formatting
- ✅ Test coverage analysis
- ✅ Enterprise coding standards

### **Security Scanning**
- 🛡️ Dependency vulnerability detection
- 🛡️ Code security pattern analysis
- 🛡️ Hardcoded secret detection
- 🛡️ XSS and injection prevention

### **Deployment Pipeline**
- 🚀 Pre-deployment validation
- 🚀 Quality and security gates
- 🚀 Build verification
- 🚀 Post-deployment health checks

### **Memory System**
- 🧠 Cross-session feature tracking
- 🧠 Duplicate detection and prevention
- 🧠 Project status dashboard
- 🧠 Development history

## 🎨 For Vibe Coders

CCOM is designed for developers who prefer natural language over complex tooling:

```bash
# Instead of:
npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build && npm run deploy

# Just say:
ccom "deploy my app"
```

**CCOM handles all the complexity while you focus on building features.**

## 🔄 Workflow Example

```bash
# Start working on a project
ccom "status"
📊 Project Status: 5 features, enterprise-ready

# Add a new feature
# ... write your code ...

# Quality check
ccom "quality audit"
🔧 **CCOM ORCHESTRATING** - Quality gates activated
✅ Code quality: Enterprise grade

# Security scan
ccom "security check"
🛡️ Security: Bank-level

# Deploy
ccom "ship it to production"
🚀 Deploying with enterprise standards...
🎉 Your app is live!

# Remember what we built
ccom "remember this payment system"
✅ Saved to memory: payment_system
```

## 🛠️ Development

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Node.js (for quality tools)
