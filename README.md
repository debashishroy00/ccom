CCOM automatically creates `.github/workflows/ccom-quality.yml`:

```yaml
name: CCOM Quality Gates

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  quality_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install CCOM
      run: pip install ccom
    - name: CCOM Quality Workflow
      run: ccom workflow quality
    - name: CCOM Security Workflow
      run: ccom workflow security
```

**Result**: Every push/PR automatically runs quality and security checks!

### **Contributing**

2. Create a feature branch
3. Run `ccom workflow quality` before committing
4. Run `ccom complete stack` to validate AWS components
5. Ensure GitHub Actions pass
6. Submit a pull request

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **File Monitoring Not Working?**
- **Windows + OneDrive**: Files in OneDrive sync may not trigger events immediately
- **Solution**: Test in `C:\temp` or similar non-synced location
- **Alternative**: File monitoring works best with direct editor saves (VS Code, etc.)

### **GitHub Actions Failing?**
```bash
# Check if CCOM is properly installed
pip show ccom

# Test workflows locally first
ccom workflow quality
ccom workflow security
```

### **Quality Checks Failing?**
```bash
# See specific issues
ccom workflow quality

# Common fixes
npm run lint --fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format        # Fix formatting
```
